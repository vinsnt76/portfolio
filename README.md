## 🧠 Features

-   **Modern UI/UX:** A clean, "pill-style" sticky header and smooth-scrolling navigation.
-   **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout that looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
-   **Light & Dark Mode:** A theme toggle that respects user preference and persists the choice in `localStorage`.
-   **Component-Based Architecture:** Built with reusable React components for maintainability and scalability.
-   **Centralized Branding:** Design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) are managed in a global CSS file for site-wide consistency.
-   **Optimized Font Loading:** Custom fonts (Montserrat, IBM Plex Sans, Raleway) are efficiently loaded from Google Fonts.
